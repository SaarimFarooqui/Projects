# TERM FREQUENCY-INVERSE DOCUMENT FREQUENCY

## About

Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical method and feature extraction technique. The core idea behind it is to find how important a word is in a document with respect to other documents. TF-IDF helps reduce the importance of common words inside a document, highlights words which are document specific, converts text into vectors and enables machine learning models to work on text.  

In short, it assigns higher weights to words that are frequent in a document but rare across the corpus. It is statistical and not semantic, does not consider word order and used in machine learning models like Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine.
